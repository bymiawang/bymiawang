### Hi, I'm Mia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore at USC focused on creating tech that impacts the communities around me, whether it's a chatbot based on my goofy friends, a platform that improves codebase readibility, or an AR headset for people with ALS.

I'm currently working as a natural language processing intern at Cognixion, where we specialize in building AI-powered assistive tech for the millions of people with communication disabilities.

When I'm not coding, I can usually be found reading (currently working on Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener), playing fetch with my goldendoodle Trumpet, and exploring local coffee shops.
