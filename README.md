### Hi, I'm Mia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a sophomore at USC trying to build cool things or impactful solutions to problems I encounter. Focused on assistive tech and generative AI.

I'm currently working as a natural language processing intern at Cognixion, where we specialize in building AI-powered AR headsets for the millions of people with communication disabilities.

When I'm not coding, I can usually be found reading (currently working on Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener), playing fetch with my goldendoodle Trumpet, and exploring local coffee shops.
